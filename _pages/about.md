I am a second year PhD student at Inria Paris, under the supervision of [Adrien Taylor](https://adrientaylor.github.io) and [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).

My research focuses on first-order (convex) optimization methods for machine learning problems, and computer-aided approaches to their worst-case guarantees. Recently, I have been working on continuous-time models related to these methods.

Prior to that, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (X2016) and got a master degree in Maths, Vision and Learning in 2020 ([master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com)) from Ecole Normale Supérieure and Ecole des Ponts.

You can find a list of my publications and codes [here](/publications/).
