I am a third year PhD student at Inria Paris, under the supervision of [Adrien Taylor](https://adrientaylor.github.io) and [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).

My research currently focuses on a principled view on concentration inequalities. Previously, I worked on
first-order convex optimization methods, applied to possibly sparse machine learning problems, as well as their continuous-time versions.
I have a strong interest in computer-aided techniques for worst-case analysis, and the so-called Performance Estimation Problems.

Prior to that, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (X2016) and got a master degree in Maths, Vision and Learning in 2020 ([master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com)) from Ecole Normale Supérieure and Ecole des Ponts.

You can find a list of my publications and codes [here](/publications/).
