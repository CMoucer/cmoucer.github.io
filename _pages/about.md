Hello, and welcome to my website!

I am Céline Moucer, currently working at the French Ministry of Finance (Direction du Budget). Since taking on this role, I have slowed down my research activities, but I’m always happy to receive suggestions, comments, and questions, and I make sure to respond in a timely manner.

In october 2024, I completed a PhD in optimization for machine learning, under the supervision of [Adrien Taylor](https://adrientaylor.github.io) and [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
My research focuses on developing constructive approaches to concentration inequalities and first-order convex optimization methods, exploring their applications to potentially sparse machine learning problems and their continuous-time formulations. I am particularly interested in computer-aided techniques for the worst-case analysis of optimization methods, also known as Performance Estimation Problems.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (X2016) and got a master degree in Maths, Vision and Learning in 2020 ([master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com)) from Ecole Normale Supérieure and Ecole des Ponts.
I am also a civil servant engineer (Corps des IPEF), working for the French administration.

You can find a list of my publications and codes [here](/publications/).
